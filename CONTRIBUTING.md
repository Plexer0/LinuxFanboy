# How to Contribute
Thank you for wanting to contribute to this (silly) project! Here is a list of things you could help with:
* Suggest Windows commands and messages to add.
* Spot any spelling and grammar issues.
* Vote on MRs
* Answer questions in the issues tab.

Since this is a small hobby project, not much help is needed at the moment.
